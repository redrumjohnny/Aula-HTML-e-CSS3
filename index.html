         <h2>Espresso</h2>
         <p>
             Is a coffee-making method of Italian origin, in which a small amount of nearly boiling water is forced under pressure (expressed) through finely-ground coffee beans. Espresso coffee can be made with a wide variety of coffee beans and roasts.</p><p>Espresso is generally thicker than coffee brewed by other methods, has a higher concentration of suspended and dissolved solids, and has crema on top (a foam with a creamy consistency).<p/><p>As a result of the pressurized brewing process, the flavors and chemicals in a typical cup of espresso are very concentrated. The three dispersed phases in espresso are what make this beverage unique.</p>

     <secton id="French Press">
         <h2>French Press</h2>
         <p>Coffee is brewed by placing coarsely ground coffee in the empty beaker and adding hot—between 93–96 °C (199–205 °F)—water, in proportions of about 30 g (1.1 oz) of coffee grounds to 500 ml (17 US fl oz) of water, more or less to taste. The brewing time is about two to four minutes.</p>
         <p> Then the mesh plunger or piston is pressed, to separate the grounds and hold them at the bottom of the beaker.</p>
         <p>A French press works best with coffee of a coarser grind than does a drip brew coffee filter, about the consistency of kosher salt. Finer coffee grounds, when immersed in water, have lower permeability, requiring an excessive amount of force to be applied by hand to lower the plunger and are more likely to seep through or around the perimeter of the press filter and into the coffee drink.</p>

     <section id="Drip Coffee">
         <h2>Drip Coffee</h2>
         <p>Brewed coffee is made by pouring hot water onto ground coffee beans, then allowing to brew. <p>There are several methods for doing this, including using a filter, a percolator, and a French press. Terms used for the resulting coffee often reflect the method used, such as drip brewed coffee, filtered coffee, pour-over coffee, immersion brewed coffee, or simply coffee.</p><p>Water seeps through the ground coffee, absorbing its constituent chemical compounds, and then passes through a filter. The used coffee grounds are retained in the filter, while the brewed coffee is collected in a vessel such as a carafe or pot.</p>
